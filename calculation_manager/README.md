# Calculation Manager

A python based manager to manage the Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation.<br>
Essentially, it uses the [Python Simulation Manager](https://github.com/so-groenen/python_simulation_manager) to pass parameters (temperatures, Monte-Carlo thermalization & measure steps etc) to the Rust project.<br>
It uses *uv* as package manager/virtual environnement. 
## Usage
Please have a look at the `ising_run_and_plot.ipynb` Notebook as well as the mini tutorial on the *Python Simulation Manager* page.
